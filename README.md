This project is basically a chrome extension making users aware of the site they are using-as suspicious website or not,by checking various conditions like length of url,the certificate duration for which site is valid,presence of any special characters like @,presence of http in domain part and many more.These conditions tell us to further continue on that website or not by giving us warning.
Here we used equal weightage to all the factors,then if sum is greater than 3,then it is a malicious url else legitimate.
Try using zphisher,an automated phishing tool to clone famous websites like facebook,google and then use extension to lknow the difference between actual and fake site.

Do try this as this is an attempt to save from cyber crimes,most famous these days.
