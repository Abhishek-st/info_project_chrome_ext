This project is basically a chrome extension making users aware of the site they are using-as suspicious website or not,by checking various conditions like length of url,the certificate duration for which site is valid,presence of any special characters like @,presence of http in domain part and many more.These conditions tell us to further continue on that website or not by giving us warning.


Do try this as this is an attempt to save from cyber crimes,most famous these days.
